### Installing/Getting Started with TidalCycles

Step One: [Pick a way to install TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Installation)
- Which installation method you will pick will depend on your machine
- I recommend the "easy" modes

Step Two: [Start SuperDirt inside SuperCollider](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Start_tidalcycles_and_superdirt_for_the_first_time)
- TidalCycles uses SuperDirt to communicate with SuperCollider
- You'll need to have SuperCollider running for sound to come out
- Personal Tip: I had to Install SuperDirt manually to get TidalCycles to work on my machine even though I used the easy installation. After I did that, I was able to open up TidalCycles.
- If you need more help, check out the ["Troubleshooting a TidalCycles Installation"](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/MacOS_installation) page on GitHub and start testing.

Step Three: [Start TidalCycles inside your Text editor](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Start_tidalcycles_and_superdirt_for_the_first_time#Start_TidalCycles_inside_your_text_editor)
- I recommend using [Atom](https://atom.io/). It's free to download online. If you did the easy installation, you should already have Atom installed. If you are using Atom, you will also [need the TidalCycles plug-in installed on Atom](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/MacOS_installation#Install_Atom_Extension).
- Here are [instructions for using Atom with TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Start_tidalcycles_and_superdirt_for_the_first_time#Instructions_for_Atom)

Step Four: [Test for sound using some code](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Start_tidalcycles_and_superdirt_for_the_first_time#Start_TidalCycles_inside_your_text_editor)

If you're getting sound, congratulations! You're ready for the [TidalCycles Tutorial](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Tutorial)
