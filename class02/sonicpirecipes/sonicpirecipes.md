## Sonic Pi Recipes
There are many ways of making music. Here are a few ways to explore how to do so using Sonic Pi.</br>
Instructions: Explore each prompt by coding with musical goals in mind while using all of the required ingredients. Use a combination of ingredients to create your piece. If you need more help making decisions, try listening/looking to an example and break down the events happening within it.

Required Ingredients:
- At least four (4) commands
- At least four (4) parameters
- At least one (1) effect (with_fx)

### 1. Traditional/Dance Music

Instructions: Code music that emulates traditional/dance music.

Useful Ingredients:
- cue and sync
- sleep

Tips:
- Use “cue” and “sync” to line up your loops (live_loop)
- See <a href="https://sonic-pi.net/tutorial.html#section-9-3">Tutorial 9.3</a> to read more about syncing live loops
- If you don't know where to start, listen to a song you like and copy the process that you hear. (ex. Drum beat happens 4 times, then the synth comes in to play chords, etc.)
- Try creating loops for every instrument you'd like to be in your "band" (ex. drums, rhythm, guitar, etc.)

Examples:
- [Sam Aaron practicing live stream](https://youtu.be/kxX6ZEhFlm4) - creator of Sonic Pi practicing
- [Rai - "Push"](https://youtu.be/BT-NBqVBIQE) - uses Sonic Pi as an accompaniment to her singing
- [Earth to Abigail Improvisation](https://youtu.be/0Ueg0nOyXec) - start from scratch session building from a beat
- [Daft Punk - Aerodynamic (cover)](https://youtu.be/cydH_JAgSfg)
