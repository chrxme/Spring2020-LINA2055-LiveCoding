## Course description
This class is a survey course to live coding methodologies, artists, and techniques and introduces live coding as an interdisciplinary approach to making work. Live coding is a performance practice that involves real-time composition, usually with the use of computer programming. It often manifests as the practice of writing code with a programming language in order to change a live process, like sound or visuals. This results is an immediate feedback loop where the performer works to manipulate a running system in real time. Topics include the algorave movement and live coding techniques involving sound, visuals, the body, and text. This class will also include readings and discussions on the history of live coding, live coding philosophies, and its position in contemporary performance and computer science. Students will be introduced to a broad range of tools and environments for coding, such as Sonic Pi, Hydra, and in-browser techniques, as well as other art-forms that inform this methodology. A performance will take place at the end of the semester to showcase the techniques investigated. No previous coding experience is necessary. Students are expected to bring a laptop with them to every class; laptops are available to checkout through the University.
